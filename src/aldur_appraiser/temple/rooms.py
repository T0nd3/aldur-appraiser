"""Temple room dataset + schema (PoE2 Vaal Temple).

The upgrade rules are ported from the Tetriszocker editor's ROOM_DATA (group
`count` / `require_all` / `min_tier`), cross-checked against the in-game Hold-Alt
tooltips and the mobalytics guide. It's the foundation everything else builds on,
so it's plain data with a typed schema and a validator.

Confirmed by the player + Hold-Alt:
  - Tier upgrades count qualifying ADJACENT rooms as a GROUP (e.g. Commander: 2/3
    adjacent Garrison-or-Transcendent together); some T3s need one of EACH type
    (`require_all`); some need a minimum source tier (Flesh Surgeon needs a T2+
    Synthflesh). The Generator/Dynamo instead POWERS rooms (directly adjacent +
    along connected paths within range), and must be connected to a road.
  - The game's "Restricted Rooms" are the Architect reward Vaults (flagged
    volatile/architect_room) — they always destabilise. A separate engine
    heuristic, chokepoint_room_cells(), flags articulation points (sole links) as
    a layout risk; that is NOT the game's "Restricted Rooms".
