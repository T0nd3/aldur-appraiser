"""Per-run placement advisor.

Each run you draw 6 random cards (rooms + paths); this ranks where to place them.
Pure functions over the engine: `score` turns a temple into a single number,
`suggest` ranks every legal (card, cell) by how much it raises the score, and
`plan_hand` greedily places a whole hand.

The score is intentionally simple and tweakable: sum of `value[room] * tier` over
placed rooms, minus a penalty per cannot-connect violation. A placement's worth =
the score delta it causes, so it automatically credits not just the placed room's
own tier but every neighbour it upgrades (and a Path that connects a Generator to
the network gets credit for the rooms that Generator then powers).

      accessible room the in-game whitelist lets it connect to (`rooms.can_connect`).
